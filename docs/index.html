				<p>Hi, I’m Sheila. I’m a tattooer at Spirited Tattooing Coalition in Philadelphia, PA. Thanks so much for being interested in my work!</p>
				<p>To book, I’ve set up a form that makes it easy for me to get information about your idea and get a dialogue going! Please click “BOOKING FORM” to set up time to get tattooed by me in Philadelphia.</p>
				<p>THE GUEST SPOT FORM IS CLOSED CURRENTLY!! I will open DC and Virginia inquiries once my waitlist is smaller and books open for future visits. 
				For now I’m trying to work through a lengthy DC waitlist and would like to chip away at some of that before flooding my inbox again. 
				Thanks for understanding!</p>
				<p>GENERAL INQUIRIES (healing questions, touch up requests, guest spot inquiries) please email me at: forkspit@gmail.com</p>
