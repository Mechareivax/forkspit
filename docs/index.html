						Hello! Thank you for your interest. I’m Sullivan (he/they). I’m a trans guy from NE PA doing tattoos in the Philadelphia area. I’ve been tattooing for 7 years between Virginia, DC and Philly. I’m passionate about making the tattoo process comfortable, safe and fun. I’m just a regular guy doing a really wild thing and I am truly so honored to do it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Below you’ll find a brief portfolio of my work. The best way to keep up with my latest work and news on me is my Instagram.
					</p>
					<p>
						I take custom design requests to my best ability and I also have many unique pre-made designs to choose from.
					</p>
					<p>
						The general booking form is currently open! Please read it thoroughly and fill it out as well as possible. The guest spot booking form opens when I have travel plans announced.
					</p>
					<p id="last-p">
						Thank you always and hope to hear from you.
