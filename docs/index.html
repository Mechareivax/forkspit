						Hello! Thank you for your interest. I’m Sheila (she/her) and below you’ll find a portfolio of my work. 
						I’m currently taking a break as I establish a proper location to tattoo at full-time. 
						I will be traveling and guest spotting in the meantime so please keep updated on my instagram or this website. 
						I appreciate your patience as I navigate finding a safe, accessible space for myself and my current/future clients. 
					</p>
					<p>The general booking form is closed, and the guest spot booking form opens when I have travel plans announced.</p>
					<p>Thank you again and always.</p>
